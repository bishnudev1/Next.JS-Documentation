### File Based Routing in Next JS :- 

1. Make all the components like Home.js, About.js, Contact.js in the pages folder and just use them by giving "/Home" or "/About" or "/Contact" [ Letter-Casing is not important here like React ].

2. Make an another folder in the pages like Blog and make a file index.js in it but you can render it by giving "/Blog".
